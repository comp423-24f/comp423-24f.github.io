<p>In this exercise, you will build a small command-line interface application in Typescript, running on Node.js, that retrieves data from the public UNC CS Experience Labs’ Web API (Application Programming Interface). Your app will retrieve and present a list of student organization names and “slugs” (URL-safe abbreviations), as well as provide more detailed output about a spefic organization of interest. Making a request to a web API involves <em>network input/output (IO)</em> which is a relatively “slow” process. Thus, the network request will be made asynchronously and your solution will be written to handle the asynchrony.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will gain exposure to new tools of the trade: linting, automatic source formatting, and testing. Additionally, you will rely on a 3rd party library, axiom, for handling the web requests (as opposed to <code>fetch</code>, as shown in class).</p>
<p>Setting up a complete suite of developer tools in a DevContainer requires some configuration and tinkering concerns beyond our scope at this point in the course, so we are going to provide a working sample container to begin your work in. Let’s go ahead and clone this repository before giving you a tour around and setting you off on your way!</p>
<h2 id="accept-the-github-classroom-assignment">0. Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment</h2>
<p>Accept Github Classroom Project via this link: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/G7-C73Sl" class="uri">https://classroom.github.com/a/G7-C73Sl</a></p>
<p>After accepting, you will be given a link to your repository. Follow it. Its URL convention is <code>github.com/</code> followed by <code>comp423-24f/ex01-async-io-</code> and your Github Username.</p>
<p>Look for the green Code button and the Local tab. Copy your repository’s URL. Clone it to your machine wherever you’d like. At this point in your CS career, we are hopeful you are able to remember, or search to remind yourself, how to clone a <code>git</code> repository from GitHub. Searches along the lines of “clone git repository from github” should prove fruitful.</p>
<h2 id="open-the-cloned-repositorys-directory-in-a-new-vscode-window">1. Open the cloned repository’s directory in a new VSCode Window</h2>
<p>You will see the project files contain starter files. You will notice a <code>.devcontainer</code> directory already established.</p>
<h2 id="devcontainer---rebuild-and-reopen-in-container">2. DevContainer - Rebuild and Reopen in Container</h2>
<p>Now for the <em>magical</em> step of opening your project in a DevContainer. Open VSCode’s command palette (Shortcut: Command+Shift+P on Mac and Control+Shift+P on Windows) and search for “Reopen in Container.” This step will may take a minute, but it should be faster than when you established your first dev container in class. Why? Because both are based on the same TypeScript image from Microsoft and you already have it downloaded!</p>
<h2 id="after-vscode-reopens-in-the-devcontainers-environment-open-a-terminal">3. After VSCode Reopens in the DevContainer’s Environment, Open a Terminal</h2>
<p>You should be able to open a new terminal and see a prompt that looks like this: <code>node -&gt; /workspaces/$REPO (main)</code>, where <code>$REPO</code> is your GitHub repository’s name.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you have started up a new DevContainer! This <code>bash</code> shell is running inside the container, which has Node.js, TypeScript, and more installed. The <code>/workspace</code> is the working directory your terminal is in, which is where your repository’s files are mounted, and <code>(main)</code> refers to the branch your <code>HEAD</code> is on. This custom shell prompt is one of the niceties that was setup in the container build.</p>
<p>As part of the container setup, dependencies are installed via <code>.devcontainer/devcontainer.json</code>’s <code>"postCreateCommand"</code> running <code>npm install</code>. If this does not complete before components of the VS Code Editor load (such as the test plugin for Jest and Prettier) you may see some red areas in VSCode’s status bar down at its bottom edge. If this is the case, once the automatic startup script has completed, try reloading the window from the command palette.</p>
<p>Open a new Terminal in your DevContainer. Try the following two commands:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>npm test</code> - This runs the project’s unit tests. You should see 1 suite and 3 tests pass.</li>
<li><code>npm run build+start hello world</code> - This builds the project and runs it. You should see the two CLI args <code>hello</code> and <code>world</code> printed in JSON list literal format.</li>
</ol>
<p>If either of these commands failed, try running <code>npm install</code> from a terminal and reloading the complete VSCode Window upon completion. Triple check you are in the DevContainer.</p>
<h2 id="code-tour">4. Code Tour</h2>
<p>Let’s walk through the starter files you are seeing in the repository at a high level. Most you will not need to touch, but you should understand the general purpose of each:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>.devcontainer/devcontainer</code> - A lot like the one you setup! However, if you open it you can see that additional customizations to VSCode have been established to automatically install some VSCode Extensions (Prettier for code formatting and Jest for unit tests) and some configuration options. Additionally, after the DevContainer is created we are installing 3rd party code in <code>node_modules</code> via <code>npm install</code>. Lastly, we run a <code>git config</code> command in order to add this project’s workspace as a safe directory.</p></li>
<li><p><code>node_modules</code> - This directory contains all of our project’s 3rd party dependency code.</p></li>
<li><p><code>src/index.ts</code> - This file boostraps execution into our project’s <code>main</code> function. You will notice it imports and calls <code>main</code> from <code>src/main.ts</code> and passes in the system variable <code>process.argv</code>. This variable contains the string arguments the command-line program was created with.</p></li>
<li><p><code>src/main.ts</code> - This file serves as the entry point to our program. You will notice <code>main</code> is defined as <code>async</code>, though it does not yet make use of any <code>await</code> functionality. On the second line, you will notice a peculiar statement. It’s worth pausing to understand it! This is an example of <em>destructuring assignment</em>. The variable on the right-hand side is <code>argv</code> which is a <code>string[]</code>. Notice on the left-hand side it <em>looks like</em> we’re declaring a list literal, but what is actually happening is we are using <em>destructuring assignment</em> syntax. The first two strings in <code>argv</code> are the <code>node</code> binary and the script (e.g. <code>dist/index.js</code>), however our program only cares about the “arguments” that follow, so we are ignoring the first two values in <code>argv</code> and assigning the <em>rest</em> to a new string list named <code>args</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>test/main.spec.ts</code> - This file contains unit tests in a behavior-driven style. Notice the significant use of arrow functions! Those are all anonymous function definitions! Notice this reads somewhat like a specification: “describe main: it should not log the program or script from argv”. This is one style of unit test possible in Jest. The value of this style is we can specify our requirements in English and then implement tests which verify they behave as expected. There is more to say about what is going on here, we will be back!</p></li>
<li><p><code>.gitignore</code> - Directories ignored by our <code>git</code> repository because they contain built artifacts (e.g. <code>dist</code> and <code>coverage</code>), 3rd party code (<code>node_modules</code>), or Mac-specific hidden files for Finder (<code>.DS_Store</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><code>.prettierignore</code> - Here, like with <code>.gitignore</code>, we tell Prettier, our automatic code reformatting library, to ignore files in built directories such as <code>dist</code> and <code>node_modules</code>. We only want prettier watching over our <code>src</code> and <code>test</code> directories!</p></li>
<li><p><code>.prettierrc</code> - This file is for additional <code>prettier</code> configuration. Ours has a few rules you can hover over the names of for a descriptin of their impact in VSCode. Prettier will automatically reformat your source code on save to ensure everyone’s spacing standards, and other stylistic concerns, are always consistent. This frees your mind from the tedium of syntax style concerns and helps make everyone’s syntactical styles standard!</p></li>
<li><p><code>babel.config.json</code> - Our test framework, Jest, requires Babel, which is a source-to-source transpiler that can transform (<em>transpile</em>) from certain dialects of JavaScript (e.g. TypeScript) into other dialects. Its usage in this project is beyond your concern, but know it’s just a utility needed for the project’s testing setup.</p></li>
<li><p><code>eslint.config.js</code> - This file contains boilerplate for our code linter, ESLint. The ES is short for <code>ECMA Script</code>, which is the true formal name of the colloqial “JavaScript” programming language. Linters are popular tools for software engineering teams that help ensure everyone uses the same conventions and standards. For example, <code>eslint</code> is what will suggest you use <code>const</code> declarations for variables, instead of <code>let</code>, if your code never reassigns the variable later on.</p></li>
<li><p><code>jest.config.ts</code> - Configuration for our unit testing framework <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>, created by developers at Facebook/Meta. Ours simply tells <code>jest</code> which directory to find our test files in: <code>./test</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>package-lock.json</code> - Opening this file you will see the <em>many</em> subdependencies needed by our top-level dependencies. In real projects in the Node.js ecosystem, you will quickly learn that lots of dependencies are common. This has its pros and cons, but generally it’s great for such a vibrant ecosystem of free, open source software to be available on a platform.</p></li>
<li><p><code>package.json</code> - This file should look familiar. You will see that we have many new <code>devDependencies</code> related to getting TypeScript, Jest, Prettier, and ESLint all working properly (and together). You will see in <code>scripts</code> there are a number of additional subcommands for working with our project than: <code>test</code> (runs <code>jest</code>), <code>coverage</code> (runs test coverage report), <code>build</code>, <code>start</code>, <code>build+start</code> (builds TypeScript to JavaScipt and starts the program), <code>clean</code> (deletes the <code>dist</code> directory).</p></li>
<li><p><code>tsconfig.json</code> - Configuration settings for TypeScript. Of note, you’ll see in <code>types</code> that both <code>node</code> and <code>jest</code> are added so that TypeScript is aware of the built-in globals of <code>node</code> and <code>jest</code>, along with their type information.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="getting-started">5. Getting Started</h2>
<p>The expected behavior of your program is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One of two subcommands is expected: <code>list</code> or <code>get</code></li>
<li>If no subcommand is provided, an <code>Error</code> should be thrown with a helpful message. The message will be printed in the handler of <code>index.ts</code></li>
<li>If a subcommand other than <code>list</code> or <code>get</code> is provided, an <code>Error</code> should be thrown with a helpful message, like expectation #2.</li>
<li>For the <code>list</code> subcommand, all organizations in the CSXL API should be printed. The output expected is one <code>($slug) $name</code> per line where <code>$slug</code> is the organization’s slug and <code>$name</code> is its name. You can see the results of this API endpoint here: <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/api/organizations" class="uri">https://csxl.unc.edu/api/organizations</a>.</li>
<li>For the <code>get</code> subcommand, an additional command-line argument with the <code>slug</code> of the organization is expected. If none is provided, an <code>Error</code> with a helpful message should be raised. If one is provided, you should use the API endpoint here: <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/api/organizations/$slug" class="uri">https://csxl.unc.edu/api/organizations/$slug</a> replacing the last URL part with the slug. For example: <a href="https://csxl.unc.edu/api/organizations/unc-cs" class="uri">https://csxl.unc.edu/api/organizations/unc-cs</a>. The result of this subcommand is showing the <code>name</code>, <code>description</code>, <code>website</code>, and <code>instagram</code> of the student organization. Should a slug not exist and the API results in an error, your program should raise a custom <code>Error</code> with a helpful message.</li>
</ol>
<p>In general, we encourage you attempt to follow a rule of the <em>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</em>. This means that a given class or <strong>function</strong> should have only responsibility or purpose. In other words, it should have only one reason to change. Achieving this in <code>main</code> is a conceptual design challenge we encourage you to wrestle with. Two benefits in designing for the <em>Single Responsibility Principle</em> are that, one, each class or function’s corresponding unit tests become more straightforward to write and, two, you are more likely to have <em>composable pieces</em> ready for reuse than overly complex units of code.</p>
<p><strong>Note for Windows Users: If you do not see changes automatically refreshing when you save files, try running <code>ng serve --poll=2000</code> instead.</strong></p>
<p>Open a web browser and navigate to <code>localhost:4200</code>. You should see “My Store”, which is the starting point for Angular’s Getting Started tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-branch-for-getting-started">7. Create a Branch for Getting Started</h2>
<p><strong>Please note! The very specific workflow given for git branches, commits, and pushes is going to be graded and part of the submission. Be sure to complete the git steps at each section.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s practice getting in the habbit of creating a branch for work in progress. Open a new terminal window in VSCode (look for the plus button) and try the following commands:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>git branch getting-started</code></li>
<li><code>git switch getting-started</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Notice how your shell prompt changes to reflect the branch you are working on! Woo! These two steps can be combined in a single command with a special flag of <code>switch</code>, such as <code>git switch --create &lt;new-branch&gt;</code>. In this example, the two commands could have been replaced with <code>git switch --create &lt;new-branch&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>The official first tutorial the development team of Angular put together to give a tour of big ideas can be found here: <a href="https://angular.io/start" class="uri">https://angular.io/start</a></p>
<p>Complete this first section on getting started, taking you to the point of listing products and seeing an alert of a product going on sale. Then, make a commit of your progress and merge it into the <code>main</code> branch.</p>
<p>Note: If you get asked by VSCode to trust this repository in order to make changes, go ahead and do so.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>git status</code> - Check the files changed.</li>
<li><code>git add .</code> - In this scenario, we want to add all changed files.</li>
<li><code>git status</code> - Confirm the files in staging/index are those we want to commit. Best practice!</li>
<li><code>git commit -m 'Completed the Getting started section of Angular Getting Started'</code> - Create a commit</li>
<li><code>git push origin getting-started</code> - Push your branch to your GitHub repository.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Pleae be sure you completed step 5 successfully now, and in future sections, before continuing on! You can verify via opening your GitHub project repository, navigating to its Code tab, looking for a dropdown button with the <code>main</code> branch. Click it and you should see the <code>getting-started</code> branch (and, in the following sections, their branch names, too). Notice switching between them changes the files you are browsing on GitHub.</strong></p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><code>git switch main</code> - Back in your terminal, switch to the <code>main</code> branch’s last commit. Notice your work is gone!</li>
<li><code>git merge getting-started</code> - Merge the <code>getting-started</code> branch into <code>main</code>. Notice, this is a Fast-forward!</li>
<li><code>git push origin main</code> - Push your remote’s <code>main</code>, also causing it to fast-forward to the same commit as the <code>getting-started</code> branch refers to.</li>
</ol>
<p>The steps of this workflow may feel like a lot of overhead when working individually on a project, but practicing them now will help when it comes time <em>very soon</em> to work in pairs on projects.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-branch-for-adding-navigation">8. Create a Branch for Adding Navigation</h2>
<p><strong>Please note! The very specific workflow given for git branches, commits, and pushes in Section 7 is going to be graded and part of the submission. Be sure to complete those steps before continuing to this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow the same process shown in Section 7 to create a local branch named <code>adding-navigation</code></strong>, switch to it, and complete the “Adding navigation” section of the Angular Getting Started Tutorial: <a href="https://angular.io/start/start-routing" class="uri">https://angular.io/start/start-routing</a></p>
<p>Once you have completed this section, follow the same workflow as before of adding files, creating a commit, pushing your branch, switching back to your main branch, merging the changes in, and so on.</p>
<p>We will look for the existance of these branches in your project’s history as part of the rubric for this exercise, so be sure to follow the steps in the previous section for each of the following sections, as well.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-branch-for-managing-data">9. Create a Branch for Managing Data</h2>
<p><strong>Please note! The very specific workflow given for git branches, commits, and pushes in Section 7 is going to be graded and part of the submission. Be sure to complete those steps before continuing to this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow the same process as above to create a local branch named <code>managing-data</code></strong>, switch to it, and complete the “Managing Data” section of the Angular Getting Started Tutorial: <a href="https://angular.io/start/start-data" class="uri">https://angular.io/start/start-data</a></p>
<p>Once you have completed this section, follow the same workflow as before of adding files, creating a commit, pushing your branch, switching back to your main branch, merging the changes in, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-branch-for-using-forms-for-user-input">10. Create a Branch for Using forms for user input</h2>
<p><strong>Please note! The very specific workflow given for git branches, commits, and pushes in Section 7 is going to be graded and part of the submission. Be sure to complete those steps before continuing to this section.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow the same process to create a local branch named <code>forms-ui</code></strong>, switch to it, and complete the “User Forms and Input” section of the Angular Getting Started Tutorial: <a href="https://angular.io/start/start-forms" class="uri">https://angular.io/start/start-forms</a></p>
<p>Once you have completed this section, follow the same workflow as before of adding files, creating a commit, pushing your branch, switching back to your main branch, merging the changes in, and so on.</p>
